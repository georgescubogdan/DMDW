Jean Georges Vongerichten learned how to make this recipe from\r\nthe great Paul Bocuse, who added it to his repertoire while cooking\r\nfor Eugenie Brazier, his teacher at La Mre Brazier in Lyon, France.\r\nChicken with vinegar is one of the great poultry dishes from that\r\narea, where the chickens are considered by many to be the best in\r\nthe world. Mr. Bocuse insisted that it was neither the amount of\r\nwork nor the cost of ingredients that determined the worthiness of a\r\ndish, but how it tasted. The variations are numerous, but the\r\npiercing flavor of vinegar is so dominant that it matters little\r\nwhether you use shallots or garlic, thyme or tarragon. One technical\r\nnote: Most wine vinegar sold in the United States has an acidity\r\nlevel of 7 percent; many French vinegars are just 5 percent acidity.\r\nSo it s best to cut strong vinegar with some water.\r\nPreheat the oven to 450 degrees. Set a large ovenproof skillet over\r\nmedium high heat. Add oil; when it is hot, place chicken in the\r\nskillet, skin side down. Cook undisturbed for about 5 minutes, or\r\nuntil chicken is nicely browned. Turn and cook 3 minutes on the other\r\nside. Season with salt and pepper.\r\nPlace skillet in the oven. Cook 15 to 20 minutes,\r\nor until almost done (juices will run clear, and there will be just a\r\ntrace of pink near the bone). Remove chicken to an ovenproof platter.\r\nPlace it in the oven; turn off the heat, and leave the door slightly\r\najar.\r\nPour all but 2 tablespoons of the cooking juices out of the skillet\r\n(discard them). Place skillet over medium high heat, and add shallots;\r\nsprinkle them with a little salt and pepper, and cook, stirring,\r\nuntil tender, about 2 minutes. Add vinegar, and raise the heat to\r\nhigh. Cook a minute or two, or until the powerful acrid smell has\r\nsubsided somewhat. Add 1/2 cup water, and cook for another 2 minutes,\r\nstirring, until the mixture is slightly reduced and somewhat\r\nthickened. Stir in butter, if desired.\r\nThis surprisingly tender vegan chocolate cake is made entirely\r\nin an 8 by 8 inch baking pan: Just toss in the ingredients,\r\nstir until you don t see any flour streaks, then bake. For\r\nflourish, add a small handful of chocolate chips before baking or\r\nsprinkle the finished cake with a little confectioners  sugar.\r\nAdapted from Mollie Katzen s \u201CHonest Pretzels: And 64 Other Amazing\r\nRecipes for Kids Who Love to Cook, this recipe was developed for\r\nkids, but adults love it, too. It s an ideal snacking cake, or you\r\ncould gussy it up with a simple ganache frosting.\r\nHeat oven to 325 degrees. Add the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda\r\nand salt to an 8 by 8 inch square glass or metal baking dish. Whisk the mixture\r\ntogether until uniform in color. Use your fingers to break apart any lumps.\r\nAdd 1 cup water along with the oil, vanilla extract and vinegar. Stir slowly with\r\na fork or a whisk in small circles to blend. Mash, scrape and stir with a fork and\r\nspoon until the mixture becomes a smooth and uniform batter.\r\nScrape the sides of the baking dish with a rubber spatula and spread the batter in\r\nan even layer. Sprinkle with chocolate chips, if using.\r\nUse a damp paper towel to wipe the edges of the baking dish clean. Carefully transfer\r\nthe dish to the oven and bake until a toothpick inserted into the center of the batter\r\ncomes out mostly clean, 28 to 33 minutes. (Instead of looking like you dipped the toothpick\r\nin chocolate frosting, it should look like it has some chocolate cake crumbs clinging to it.)\r\nLayer cakes are pretty, but for many, they require far too much work to make on a regular basis.\r\nThis cake, adapted from \u201CModern Baking: Cakes, Cookies and Everything in Between by Donna Hay,\r\nmay find a place in your recipe repertoire. It requires just two bowls \u2014 one for the cake and one\r\nfor the frosting \u2014 and there s no need to separate wet and dry ingredients. You just toss everything\r\ninto a bowl and stir. The end result is a tender, sophisticated cake slathered with a glossy milk chocolate\r\nsour cream ganache. Ms. Hay sprinkled black sea salt around the edges of her cake with stunning effect,\r\nbut traditional white sea salt looks beautiful, too.\r\nHeat oven to 350 degrees. Line 2 8 inch round cake tins with parchment paper. Place the flour,\r\ncocoa, sugar, eggs, milk, butter, dark chocolate and vanilla in a large bowl and whisk until smooth.\r\n(You may need to use a spatula to start, but use a whisk once the ingredients begin to combine.) Divide\r\nthe mixture evenly between the tins and bake for 35 to 40 minutes or until a wooden skewer inserted\r\ninto the center comes out clean. Allow to cool in the tins for 10 minutes before turning out onto wire racks to cool completely.\r\nMake the ganache: Place the sour cream and melted chocolate in a large bowl. Whisk to combine and refrigerate for\r\n10 to 15 minutes or until firm. Place 1 of the cakes on a cake stand or plate. Spread with half the ganache.\r\nTop with the remaining cake and ganache. Sprinkle with the salt to serve.\r\n
