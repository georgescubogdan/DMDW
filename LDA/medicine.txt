\r\nFlu is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses that infect the nose,\r\nthroat, and sometimes the lungs. It can cause mild to severe illness, and at times can lead\r\nto death. The best way to prevent flu is by getting a flu vaccine each year.\r\nMost experts believe that flu viruses spread mainly by tiny droplets made when people\r\nwith flu cough, sneeze or talk. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby.\r\nLess often, a person might get flu by touching a surface or object that has flu virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose or possibly their eyes.\r\nPrimary headaches are stand alone illnesses caused directly by the overactivity of, or problems with, structures in the head that are pain sensitive.\r\nThis includes the blood vessels, muscles, and nerves of the head and neck. They may also result from changes in chemical activity in the brain.\r\nCommon primary headaches include migraines, cluster headaches, and tension headaches.\r\nA migraine headache may cause a pulsating, throbbing pain usually only on one side of the head. The aching may be accompanied by\r\nRebound or medication overuse headaches stem from an excessive use of medication to treat headache symptoms.\r\nThey are the most common cause of secondary headaches. They usually begin early in the day and persist throughout the day.\r\nThey may improve with pain medication, but worsen when its effects wear off.\r\nWhich Factors Inhibit the Production of Novel Antiviral Drugs?\r\nThe rapid development of drug resistance, especially those connected with HIV4\u20137 and influenza.\r\nViruses multiply in host cells which, in turn, restrict the virusspecific metabolic sites that could be targeted by a particular antiviral agent without having any adverse effect on the host cell.\r\nEach virus has its own unique biosynthetic pathway. Therefore, the production of a generic drug that could target a wide range of viruses, is difficult.\r\nMajor Advantages of Nanomaterials in Antiviral Therapy:\r\nNanoparticles have different shapes and morphologies\r\nNanometric size allows drug delivery through impermeable barriers\r\nLarge surface area to volume ratio is beneficial for large drug loads and improved efficacy\r\nDecreases the emergence of drug resistance\r\nIncreased possibility of personalized therapy\r\nAntiviral Nanotherapeutics\r\nNanomedicine\r\nSeveral nanomedicines have already been approved, or are currently undergoing the approval process, to be used for the treatment of viral infections. Some of the potential nanotherapeutics under development are discussed below.\r\n\r\nHuman Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV):\r\nThe treatment is based on the usage of drugs that target the various stages in the life cycle of the virus. The current antiretroviral (ARV) armamentarium includes protease inhibitors, nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors, nonnucleoside inhibitors, entry/fusion inhibitors, and integrase inhibitors.\r\n\r\nModern drug design involves the incorporation of the ARV drug with nanosystems, which decrease the dosage requirements and toxicity. This method of drug delivery improves the safety and efficacy profiles of the drug.\r\n\r\nHepatitis B Virus (HBV):\r\nHBV is responsible for the inflammation and cirrhosis of the liver and can also cause liver cancer. This virus accounts for more than 700,000 deaths per year.\r\n\r\nCurrent antiHBV nanotherapy includes the use of pegylated IFN, lamivudine, adefovir, interferon (IFN)\u03B1, etc.\r\n\r\nHepatitis C Virus (HCV):\r\nThe major complication of HCV includes liver cirrhosis and liver cancer. Significant HCV inhibition was reported using nanozymes. These nanozymes are extremely stable against enzymatic degradation and possess very low levels of toxicity.\r\n\r\nInfluenza:\r\nInfluenza is an immensely contagious respiratory disease. The genomic sequence of the influenza virus is capable of rapid mutations, thereby, giving rise to several novel strains. Nanotrap particles are thermoresponsive hydrogels.\r\n\r\nThese particles possess the property of entrapping viral RNA and viral proteins that cause the disease. This is indeed a very novel technology that can be utilized in the treatment of influenza.\r\n\r\nAnother method to treat influenza involves the use of liposomes and oseltamivir incorporated silver nanoparticles as drug delivery agents.\r\n\r\nHerpes Simplex Virus (HSV):\r\nHSV causes oral and facial lesions, encephalitis, genital infections, etc. In the treatment of HSV, promising results have been observed (including a reduction in the periodicity of drug administration) by the use of nanoparticles loaded with acyclovir.\r\n\r\nHuman Papillomavirus (HPV):\r\nHPV primarily infects epithelial cells. HPV could result in common warts, cervical neoplasia, or cancer. Nanobased drugs incorporate siRNA for the treatment of HPV16 and HPV18.\r\n\r\nThese nanoparticlebased drugs express their antiviral potential through the E7 gene.\r\n\r\nHuman Parainfluenza Virus (HPIV):\r\nThis virus primarily infects human epithelial cells. The respiratory tract of infants and children are the primary targets of the disease caused by HPIV. Silver nanoparticles have recently been found to be effective against HPIV.\r\n\r\nEbola Virus Disease (EVD):\r\nThis virus is extremely deadly. It causes a highly infectious disease in humans and other primates. Treatment of EVD involves the usage of liposomes containing siRNA. Clinical trials have shown mixed results.\r\n\r\nThe drug did not show any effective results in patients in advanced stages of the disease. However, in milder cases, the drug showed promising results.\r\nInfluenza is a highly contagious respiratory disease caused by influenza viruses. The name originated in 15th century Italy, from an epidemic of the disease attributed to \u201Cinfluence of the stars.\u201D The first pandemic (epidemic occurring worldwide, crossing international boundaries) that was clearly caused by influenza virus happened in 1580.\r\n\r\nAt least four pandemics of influenza occurred throughout 19th century, while three of them occurred in the 20th century. Each one differed from the others with respect to viral subtypes, epidemiology and disease severity. The first pandemic of the 21st century occurred between 2009 and 2010.\r\nBetween May of 1918 and April of 1919, a highly virulent H1N1 strain of the influenza virus, also known as the Spanish flu, killed at least 50 million people worldwide \u2013 five times more when compared to those who died in the World War One. A majority of deaths was a result of secondary bacterial infections (such as pneumonia) that were particularly serious in those suffering from underlying pulmonary illnesses, such as tuberculosis.\r\n\r\nUnlike earlier pandemics and seasonal influenza outbreaks, the 1918 pandemic resulted in high mortality rates among healthy adults. In fact, the illness and mortality rates were highest among adults between 20 and 40 years of age. Epidemiologic evidence strongly suggested that the causative virus was moving from humans to swine.\r\n\r\nThe 19571958 pandemic has often been dubbed as the first pandemic in the era of modern virology, as it was the first time the rapid global spread of an influenza virus was available for laboratory evaluation. Also known as the Asian flu, this pandemic resulted in two million deaths worldwide.\r\n\r\nAlthough the percentage of infected people was high, the resulting disease was relatively mild compared to the Spanish flu, thus resulting in fewer deaths. Studies revealed that the strain responsible for the Asian flu (H2N2) arose by genetic reassortment of a bird virus.\r\nhe first influenza pandemic of the 21st century, initially reported in April 2009 in Mexico, swept through the Northern Hemisphere in two waves. This pandemic raised global concerns rooted in experience from previous pandemics \u2013 especially from the notorious Spanish flu which killed 50 millions of people.\r\n\r\nVirus responsible for the pandemic was a novel H1N1 strain derived from human, swine and avian strains, hence it was informally termed \u201Cswine flu\u201D. Cases of influenza caused by this strain have been confirmed in most of the countries throughout the world by the World Health Organization (WHO).\r\n\r\nIt caused widespread and quite unusual outbreaks of the disease in the summer and very high levels of disease during the winter. It was also characterized by a noteworthy dominance of the pandemic virus over other seasonal influenza viruses, and also by an unusual clinical pattern where the most severe cases occurred in younger age groups.\r\n\r\nBetween 150 and 575 thousand people died from 2009 H1N1 virus infection during the first year of the virus circulation. A disproportionate number of deaths occurred in Africa and Southeast Asia, where access to prevention and treatment resources were limited.\r\n\r\nAlthough this influenza pandemic was hard on the people younger than 65 years of age, the impact on the global population overall during the first year was less severe than in previous pandemics. The impact of illness was also minimized by adequate prevention, as 80 million people were vaccinated against H1N1.\r\n\r\nOn August 10 2010, WHO announced that the H1N1 influenza incident has moved into the postpandemic period. Based on the data about past pandemics, the 2009 virus is expected to linger as a seasonal virus for years to come. And while the level of concern is not high anymore, alertness on the part of national health authorities remains a pivotal issue.\r\nAmong humans, only three subtypes of influenza A virus are known to exist and these include H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2. The influenza virus is capable of mutating and forming different strains, although the symptoms caused by new strains are the same as those seen with the original virus. Therefore, the symptoms caused by H1N2 are no more severe than those caused by other strains of the virus and H1N2 has not been associated with any particular increase in influenza activity. However, frequent mutation of the influenza virus does mean that regular vaccinations are sometimes required to protect people against any newly emerging strains.\r\n\r\nThe H1N2 strain was identified between December 1988 and March 1989 in six cities across China. Nineteen H1N2 isolates were identified during this time, but no further spread occurred. During the 2001 to 2002 flu season in the northern hemisphere, H1N2 was identified in the United States, Canada, France, Romania, Ireland, Latvia, Oman, India, Malaysia, and Singapore. The earliest reported outbreak occurred in India on May 31st, 2001.\r\n\r\nOn February 6th, 2002, the first cases of H1N2 were reported in the UK, Egypt and Israel by the World Health Organization and by the Public Health Laboratory Service in the UK.\r\n\r\nAnother strain called the 2001\u20132002 Influenza H1N2 Wisconsin seems to have evolved through mutation of the H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes already circulating. The virus has a similar hemagglutinin protein and neuraminidase protein to those found on the current H1N1 virus and H3N2 viruses, respectively. This means the flu vaccine should protect against this influenza virus as well as the current H1N1, H3N2 and influenza B viruses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n
