The UK currently has the highest coronavirus death toll in Europe, with more than 34,000 fatalities attributed to COVID19.\r\n\r\nThe Professional Footballers Association (PFA) has been involved in Premier League meetings and has raised the issue of players not wanting to be put at risk by returning too soon.\r\n\r\n\"We have been assured of the intentions of all that there would be no resumption unless guarantees of safety could be given to the players,\" said PFA deputy chief executive Bobby Barnes.\r\n\r\nThe league and its clubs have stressed repeatedly that they will only return when it is safe to do so and will not take resources away from the UKs National Health System.\r\n\r\nA revised date for the restart?\r\nWhen English football was suspended on March 13, there were 92 total Premier League fixtures still to be played in the season.\r\n\r\nThroughout discussions, clubs have remained committed to completing the 201920 campaign amid compelling financial and sporting reasons.\r\n\r\nThe Premier League had previously identified June 12 for matches to possibly start again, albeit behind closed doors with no fans in attendance.\r\n\r\nBut there is now an expectation this date will need to be pushed back.\r\n\r\nWhile the German Bundesliga resumed competitive action at the weekend, players had resumed noncontact training nearly five weeks before.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that a new date for the return of the Premier League could be 19 or 26 June.\r\n\r\nIt had also been initially proposed that matches could be played at neutral grounds, but a number of clubs had voiced opposition to this suggestion.\r\n\r\nUEFA has set a deadline of May 25 for European leagues to finalise plans for restarting the football season, which it hopes to be completed by the end of July.\r\n\r\nBetween now and then, further meetings will take place between in the UK between football authorities, including assessing the success or failure of Project Restarts stage one.\r\nThe Champions League and Europa League look increasingly likely to be played exclusively in August after more talks about the remainder of the 201920 season on Wednesday.\r\n\r\nUefa told the 55 associations on Tuesday there was still the possibility of the competitions being played throughout June, July and August.\r\n\r\nBut BBC Sport understands the latest discussions revolved almost exclusively around a plan to complete the domestic leagues by 31 July, with European competition following after that.\r\n\r\nNothing definitive has been agreed but Uefa is keen to leave all options on the table for as long as possible given the general uncertainty across Europe and in the knowledge there is no guarantee the season will be finished.\r\n\r\nHowever, there is a view that travel restrictions are more likely to have eased in August, which would be necessary for a crossborder competition.\r\n\r\nThe scenario envisaged would be for the quarterfinals and semifinals of the respective European competitions to be played as twolegged ties between 11 and 22 August, although these could yet become oneoff games.\r\n\r\nIn the plans now being discussed, there would be some flexibility for domestic fixtures to be played in August, should a July conclusion prove impossible.\r\n\r\nThe Premier League has nine rounds of fixtures remaining but in Spain and Italy, two countries that have been badly affected, there are still 11 and 12 rounds left respectively  although both have fewer cup games to fit into their schedules.\r\n\r\nUefa hopes the situation will become clearer in the next fortnight but completing the season in this way would cause the least disruption to its qualification competition for the 202021 season, which was supposed to start at the end of June but has been delayed indefinitely.
